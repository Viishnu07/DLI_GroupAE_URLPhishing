# DLI_GroupAE_URLPhishing

This repository contains our group project for the **Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection** module. The goal is to apply a deep learning model to detect **phishing URLs** using character- and domain-based features extracted from a real-world dataset.

The model is trained, tested, and evaluated in **Google Colab** and meets the assignment requirements including metrics, visualizations, and proper documentation.
