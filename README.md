# DLI_GroupAE_URLPhishing

This repository contains our group project for the **Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection** module. The goal is to apply a deep learning model to detect **phishing URLs** using character- and domain-based features extracted from a real-world dataset.

The model is trained, tested, and evaluated in **Google Colab** and meets the assignment requirements including metrics, visualizations, and proper documentation.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Detect phishing URLs using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model trained on a public dataset with over **120,000+ samples**. The final evaluation uses metrics such as **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and a **confusion matrix**.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

We use standard binary classification metrics:

- ✅ **Accuracy**
- ✅ **Precision**
- ✅ **Recall**
- ✅ **F1-score** (Target: ≥ 0.90)
- ✅ **ROC-AUC**
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
